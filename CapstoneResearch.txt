doing a littl research/maybe changing my whole capstone idea currently.

Thinking about doing a Magic the Gathering organizer app.
MVP behavior is user can add/edit/delete mtg cards to their collection

Use an API to lookup cards by name or set etc.
(MTG API - https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)

Quick reference button for all game formats?

Is this card banned? Button

Open a random booster functionality? /sets/:id/booster 

Banner that has a random flavor text?
